# SQL Master Web App

This project was developed during my internship at **NIT Open Labs Ghana**.  
It is designed to help students practice SQL queries in an interactive way.  
The system validates student-written SQL queries against correct solutions, 
ensuring flexibility for queries that produce the same results but are written differently.

## Features
- Random SQL questions categorized by difficulty (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Query checking and validation against expected results
- Score tracking with points based on difficulty
- Review of past attempts for learning and improvement

## How it Works
1. Students log in to the system.
2. Questions are fetched randomly from the database.
3. Students write their SQL queries as answers.
4. The system executes and compares the results with the correct solution.
5. Scores are awarded based on correctness and question difficulty.

## Technologies Used
- PHP (Server-side rendering)
- MySQL (Database)
- Bootstrap (Frontend styling)
- JavaScript (Frontend interactions)
